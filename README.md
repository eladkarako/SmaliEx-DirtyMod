<h1>SmaliEx-DirtyMod</h1>

Based on latest snapshot of https://github.com/testwhat/SmaliEx/tree/snapshot,  
which has oat2dex v0.90,   
but this one uses smali and baksmali v2.4.0 (instead of v2.2.3.0).  

And I've also built fat-jars with all the dependencies which is useful for some.

built with gradle 3.5, all build resedue is kept (<code>.ignore</code> files ignored..),  
you can dig through looking for builds folders in github, or download the whole thing https://github.com/eladkarako/SmaliEx-DirtyMod/archive/master.zip  
or get just the jars in https://github.com/eladkarako/SmaliEx-DirtyMod/releases  


you don't no need to build anything.

if you do wish to modify or contribute the source-code head-over to https://github.com/testwhat/SmaliEx/tree/snapshot  
or talk to https://github.com/JesusFreke

The jars are not signed and not aligned.


the license is whatever the license of the projects are.
